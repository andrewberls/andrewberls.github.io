<p>Winter break is coming up fast, meaning I have a few weeks of rare free time. I want to use the time to learn as much as possible about topics I don't consider myself strong in. I've put together a list of things I've been wanting to learn, but it's incomplete. I welcome suggestions and additions, and I'll add them to the list - I'd love to foster a discussion on some interesting topics!</p>

<h3>Scala</h3>
<p class="list-head">This is the big one for me - Scala is a statically typed language that brings functional programming concepts to the JVM. It's very fast (sorry Ruby), and gaining popularity, notably at Twitter. I have a feeling it will become one of the next big things.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://blog.redfin.com/devblog/2010/05/how_and_why_twitter_uses_scala.html">Why does Twitter use Scala?</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://typesafe.com/resources/book/scala-for-the-impatient">Scala for the Impatient</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Backbone.js</h3>
<p class="list-head">Client-side MVC (MV*) applications and frameworks are becoming more and more popular. I've never spent too much time working with Backbone, so I want to learn more about how apps with it are structured and built.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.jamesyu.org/2011/01/27/cloudedit-a-backbone-js-tutorial-by-example/">A BackboneJS Tutorial By Example</a></li>

</ul>


<h3>Graphs</h3>
<p class="list-head">Graphs play a central role in most large companies today (think Facebook's social graph), and I have a feeling it's something I'll absolutely need to know very soon. Goal: understand the basics of graph theory and their various uses.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory (Wikipedia)</a></li>
  <li><a href="ttp://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0303516/">Paper: Structure and Function of Complex Networks</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>SQL</h3>
<p class="list-head">I spend most of my time working with SQL databases through an ORM. I've been putting off learning the basics of raw SQL.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www2.aao.gov.au/2dfgrs/Public/Release/Database/sql_intro.pdf">Intro to Structured Query Language (1)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thundersoftware.com/churchdb/sqltutorial/sql_tutorial.html">Intro to Structured Query Language (2)</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>NoSQL</h3>
<p class="list-head">NoSQL is everybody's favorite buzzword nowadays. The term is rather poorly defined, but I want to understand the implications and advantages of using a 'NoSQL' database such as MongoDB or Redis over a relational one.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dvirsky/introduction-to-redis">Introduction to Redis</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://simonwillison.net/static/2010/redis-tutorial/">Redis Tutorial</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Introduction">Introduction to MongoDB</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Google</h3>
<p class="list-head">Google has built some amazing technologies to power a business of their size - MapReduce is an extremely popular paradigm that inspired the Hadoop project, and Spanner is a revolutionary globally distributed database. Their papers are essential reading.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html">Paper: BigTable</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html">Paper: MapReduce</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://research.google.com/archive/spanner.html">Paper: Spanner</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Ruby</h3>
<p class="list-head">I consider myself fairly strong at Ruby, so this is the 'fun' stuff. It's always interesting to look at the internals.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/ruby-mri-code-walk-tour-6020.html">A Simple Tour of the Ruby MRI Source Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aISNtCAZlMg">Symbol#to_proc with Peter Cooper</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/1233-aloharuby2012-refactoring-from-good-to-great">Refactoring from Good to Great</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Data Warehousing</h3>
<p class="list-head">This is a topic I know very little about and will likely run into later. Key questions: why do companies do it? How is it accomplished - what is a dimension? What is a fact?</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse">Data Warehouse (Wikipedia)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jsbi/introduction-to-data-warehousing">Introduction to Data Warehousing</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>D3.js</h3>
<p class="list-head">D3 is a library for manipulating and displaying documents based on data. The possibilities here are endless - I want to see if I can make something out of it. Idea: mash up open source datasets.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://d3js.org/">http://d3js.org/</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Misc</h3>
<p class="list-head">This is an aggregation of stuff that doesn't really fit into any of the previous categories.</p>
